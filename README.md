# Portfolio a la Vue

**Ingredients**: Vue 3, Vite, Headless UI and Tailwind

Just wanted to get some reps in using Vue 3 and Tailwind mainly. Headless UI turned out to be a pretty awesome component library that had the simple things I needed for my portfolio. Vite is also _very fast_ and I definitely dig it.

Granted this is a small portfolio site not a production app ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
